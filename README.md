# Cat With Heart or The cutest app.
<hr>

##### This is the first application that I've created using SFML. The main idea of the app is the cat holds the heart, and if a user changes the mouse position, the heart's position also changes.<br><br> Yeah, you can say that it is a simple app. It is true, but the beauty hides in the simple things, doesn't it? <br><br> In the next gif, you can see how it works. <i>(Oh feel free to view the code)</i>.
